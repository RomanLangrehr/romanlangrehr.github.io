I am a Postdoc in the group of [Mohammad Hajiabadi](https://sites.google.com/view/mdhajiabadi/home) at the University of Waterloo. Before that, I did my PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Dennis Hofheinz](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/dhofheinz/). Even earlier, I completed my Bachelor and Master in computer science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where both my Bachelor and Master thesis were supervised by [Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan).

# Reserach interests
I am interested in various cryptographic primitives, and I focus mostly on *non-interactive key exchange*, *(registered) functional encryption* and other *advanced encryption schemes*. I am interested in understanding the relation between different primitives via generic constructions, *black-box separations* and *metareductions*, but I am also interested in concrete constructions from algebraic assumptions, in particular from *(pairing) group* or *lattice* assumptions.
